# GitHub Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Done

Your code is committed and ready to push to GitHub!

## 🔐 Quick Push (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: `evenly-schedule-viewer`
3. Description: `Treatment Coordinator scheduling dashboard`
4. Choose: **Private** (recommended) or Public
5. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repo

Copy your GitHub username and run this (replace `YOUR_USERNAME`):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/evenly-schedule-viewer.git
```

**Example** (if your username is `johndoe`):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/evenly-schedule-viewer.git
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your code is now on GitHub! 🎉

## 🔄 Future Updates

After the initial push, whenever you want to update GitHub:

```bash
# Make your changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push
```

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel from GitHub

Once on GitHub, deploy to Vercel:

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com**
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
4. Select your `evenly-schedule-viewer` repo
5. Click **"Deploy"**

Now every time you push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys! 🔥

## 🔑 SSH Alternative (Optional)

If you prefer SSH instead of HTTPS:

```bash
# Step 2 (SSH version):
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/evenly-schedule-viewer.git

# Step 3 (same):
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys

### "Remote already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
# Then run Step 2 again
```

### "Permission denied"
- Check your GitHub username is correct
- Ensure you have write access to the repository
